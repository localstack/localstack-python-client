# LocalStack Python Client

This is an easy-to-use Python client for [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack).
The client library provides a thin wrapper around [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) which
automatically configures the target endpoints to use LocalStack for your local cloud
application development.

## Prerequisites

To make use of this library, you need to have [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)
installed on your local machine. In particular, the `localstack` command needs to be available.

## Installation

The easiest way to install *LocalStack* is via `pip`:

```
pip install localstack-client
```

## Usage

This library provides an API that is identical to `boto3`'s. For example, to list the SQS queues
in your local (LocalStack) environment, use the following code:

```
import localstack_client.session

session = localstack_client.session.Session()
sqs = session.client('sqs')
assert sqs.list_queues() is not None
```

If you use `boto3.client` directly in your code, you can mock it.

```
import localstack_client.session
import pytest


@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def boto3_localstack_patch(monkeypatch):
    session_ls = localstack_client.session.Session()
    monkeypatch.setattr(boto3, "client", session_ls.client)
    monkeypatch.setattr(boto3, "resource", session_ls.resource)
```

```
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
assert sqs.list_queues() is not None  # list SQS in localstack
```
